  longDescription:
    "I embarked on my journey in the field of IT in 2017 when I enrolled in an IT professional course. During this program, I acquired the fundamental knowledge of programming, sparking my interest in frontend and web development. Upon completing the course in 2020, I decided to set myself apart from my peers by developing my final project using React, which earned me the highest possible grade of 20/20. Since then, I have continuously delved into frontend technologies.\nFollowing that, I pursued my bachelor's degree in IT Engineering at IPCA, which further honed my IT engineering skills and shaped me into the engineer I am today. I learned about various topics, including Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Databases, Computer Vision, Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, Agile Methodologies, and more.\n\nRelevant subjects and topics:\n- OOP (C#)\n- Software analysis and modeling (SCRUM)\n- Software Engineering (SCRUM, Agile)\n- Data storage and access (PostgresSQL)\n- Computer Vision (C)\n- Language Processing (Python with PLY)\n- Data communication (Python with Flask to create a Web API, and Angular)\n- Software development project (C# with Entity Framework, SQL Server, and Angular)\n- Web development (Angular 13 and pure JS)\nGit and GitHub have been used throughout all the course.",
