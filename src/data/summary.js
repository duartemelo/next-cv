  longDescription: "Throughout my entire life, I have always maintained a strong connection with the IT world. Even as a young child, before I even knew how to read, I could operate a computer and engage in gaming. As I progressed through school, I faced the pivotal decision of choosing a career path. While the answer might be clear to you, it wasn't so evident to me back then. I found myself torn between pursuing a career in music or one as an IT engineer.\nToday, I am immensely content with my choice to follow the IT path. Despite being a passionate music enthusiast, I derive great satisfaction from problem-solving and possess an inherent curiosity about the inner workings of things - qualities that align well with the role of an engineer.\nAt the age of 15, I enrolled in the Management and Programming of Computer Systems Course at Escola Profissional de Braga. This experience provided me with a foundation in programming, enabling me to undertake my initial projects and achieve noteworthy grades, subsequently earning me merit awards.\nFollowing the completion of this course, I continued my education at IPCA to pursue a degree in IT Engineering. This phase allowed me to refine my IT Engineering skills and transform into a qualified engineer.\nDespite my passion for learning, I opted to take a break after obtaining my IT Engineering degree and entered the workforce as a developer. Frontend technologies have always held a special allure for me, prompting me to embark on a career as a Frontend Engineer at Useflow, where I am engaged in React-based projects.",
