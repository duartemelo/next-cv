  longDescription: "My journey as a developer began in 2019 when I undertook an internship at Camp Tecnologico in Bilbao during my month-long Erasmus program there. Upon knowing that I had been accepted for the Erasmus internship, I felt a surge of happiness and pride in myself, as only the most outstanding students were chosen.\nDuring this internship, I had the opportunity to work with a semi-humanized robot named Pepper, utilizing Python. While my Python scripts were relatively simple, considering my level of knowledge at that time, they were already remarkable. The internship supervisor was astounded by my ability to research the robot and control it using a gamepad.\nFollowing this experience, in 2020, I pursued another internship at lluni software - a company specializing in software development for insurance companies. During this stint, I engaged in research focused on API benchmarking and APM software, including tools like Kibana.\nSubsequently, I enrolled in the IT Engineering Bachelor's degree program at IPCA. One of the noteworthy aspects of this course was the inclusion of a mandatory internship in the final year. I completed this internship at Useflow Europa, primarily focusing on React development. I also took the opportunity to learn Flutter and successfully developed an MVP mobile app.\nAs a result of my performance, Useflow expressed interest in hiring me as a Frontend Engineer. In my current role, I am engaged in developing features for Useflow's core projects, utilizing technologies such as React, TypeScript, Redux, Styled Components, and Tailwind, among others.",
